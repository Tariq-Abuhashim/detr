$ conda activate myenv

Export the Environment to a YAML File

$ conda env export > environment.yml

If you want to make the environment file more generic and not tied to specific build numbers (which might be platform-specific), you can exclude build numbers from the export. 
This makes the environment file more flexible across different platforms.

$ conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

The default export includes a prefix line at the end of the environment.yml file, specifying the path to the environment on your current system. 
This might not be desirable if you're sharing the environment file or using it in version control. 
To exclude the prefix, you can manually remove the line from the YAML file or use a tool like grep to filter it out during export:

$ conda env export --no-builds | grep -v "^prefix: " > environment.yml

Recreating the Environment

$ conda env create -f environment.yml
